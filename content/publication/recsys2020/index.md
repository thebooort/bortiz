abstract: "Tasks such as physical training planning, computer hardware configuration, or fully dietary advice are problems that exhibit multiple choices, composed in turn of simpler items (specific exercises, components, or recipes). An ideal recommender system would not only recommend simple items based on the user's tastes but would offer a set of items that suit the user's needs and preferences so that they form a meaningful structure that can evolve over time. This work proposes the incorporation of item generation systems as a preprocessing stage in the recommendation process through evolutionary algorithms. We found that genetic algorithms are still an interesting and powerful computational tool that has not been fully developed for this task. We propose a theoretical model that can deal with problems from different areas, incorporating the ability to recommend complex objects with flexible restrictions and specific structures that depend on the user and its evolution. Finally, this approach will be tested in different scenarios, such as the Stance4Health European project, where a personalized nutrition service based on user microbiota is being developed based on this concept."
