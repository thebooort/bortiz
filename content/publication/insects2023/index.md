abstract:   Currently, image recognition and classification systems based on artificial intelligence are a well-established technology. Numerous applications and systems have been developed for animal recognition in photographs, yielding excellent results. However, the identification of arthropods remains a challenge for these technologies due to the great variety and complexity of arthropods and the difficulties that arise from visual identification. In such cases, a textual description based on observers’ memory may be the only starting point available. To address this problem, this article presents a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based system for classifying arthropods at different taxonomic levels, along with an associated corpus of arthropod descriptions in Spanish. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
