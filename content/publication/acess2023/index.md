abstract:   Over the last few years, the ability of recommender systems to assist in various environments has been increasing. Several systems aim to provide solutions in highly complex domains such as nutrition, housing, or traveling. This article presents a recommendation system capable of utilizing different input sources (data and knowledge-based) and generating a complex structured output. An evolutionary approach is employed to combine several unitary items within a flexible structure, creating an initial set of complex configurable items. Subsequently, a content-based approach refines these candidates in terms of preferences to offer a final recommendation. The article concludes with the application of this approach to the healthy diet recommendation problem, highlighting its strengths in this domain. Â© 2013 IEEE.
